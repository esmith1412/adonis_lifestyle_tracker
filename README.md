# Adonis Lifestyle Tracker
A Python program I use to keep track of my nutrition and exercise information, for the Adonis Lifestyle System.

It's used to keep track of the calorie and protein goals for each week, and how the foods I eat affect those goals. It also keeps track of the resistance used for each rep range of each exercise, for each week of the program.
